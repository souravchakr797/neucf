# NeuCF Model for Collaborative Filtering

This project implements **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NeuCF)** for recommendation systems using TensorFlow and Keras. It combines **Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF)** and **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** to enhance user-item interaction predictions.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Negative Sampling**: Efficiently generates negative samples for training.
- **Hybrid Model (GMF + MLP)**: Merges matrix factorization and deep learning-based approaches.
- **Batch Normalization & Dropout**: Helps improve model training stability and generalization.
- **Pretrained Model Loading**: Supports loading the latest trained NeuCF model.

## ðŸš€ How to Train the Model
Run the following command to train the NeuCF model:
```sh
python src/train.py
```
This will:
1. Load user-item interaction data.
2. Generate negative samples.
3. Train the NeuCF model.
4. Save the trained model in the `models/` directory.

## ðŸ–¥ Running the Server
To serve recommendations via an API, run:
```sh
python main.py
```
This will start a API server to make predictions using the trained NeuCF model.

## ðŸ“Œ Model Architecture
The model combines:
- **GMF (Generalized Matrix Factorization)**: Uses embeddings and element-wise multiplication.
- **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**: Uses deep learning layers for non-linear feature interactions.
- **Final Layer**: Merges GMF & MLP outputs and predicts the probability of interaction.

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
Ensure the required dependencies are installed:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
